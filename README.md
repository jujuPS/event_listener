# event_listener   <br>

This is a training for how to make multiple independent listeners for the same events.  <br> 

The point of the example：  <br> <br>
1 . Let user input how many div there want in the text, and when the user click submit button, these div group will show in the page. <br> <br>
2 . One div has to be used with one button, This is a div group.  <br> <br>
3 . We want these div group are independent, that means if we click the first button which name is called animate, We just only trigger that Corresponding div, so we must use object concept to write the div group. <br> <br>
4 .
