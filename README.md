# event_listener   <br><br>

This is a training for how to make multiple independent listeners for the same events.  <br>
The point of the exampleï¼š  <br> <br>
1 . Let user input how many div they want in the text, and when the user click submit button, These div group will show in this page. <br> <br>
2 . One div has to be used with one button, This is a div group.  <br> <br>
3 . We want these div group are independent, That means if we click the first button which name is called animate, We just only trigger that corresponding div. To do this , We can use object concept to write the div group. <br> <br>
4 . Because it is impossible to know in advance how many number will be input in the text, so we have to use for loop to produces code and append code.
